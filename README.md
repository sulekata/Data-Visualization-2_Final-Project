# Data Visualization 2 - Practical Data Visualization with R

This repository contains Kata SÃ¼le's final project for the [Data Visualization 2](https://github.com/daroczig/CEU-DV2) course at Central European University. For the project I used a dataset about [board games](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-03-12) from the GitHub page of the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.
